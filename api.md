* What does this line do:

```ts
@HostBinding('class.valid') isValid;
```

Binds a host element property (here, the CSS class valid) to a directive/component property (isValid).

* What would be a good use for NgZone service?

The most common use of this service is to optimize performance when starting a work consisting of one or more asynchronous tasks that don't require UI updates or error handling to be handled by Angular. Such tasks can be kicked off via runOutsideAngular and if needed, these tasks can reenter the Angular zone via run.
